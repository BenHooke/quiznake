Thanks for checking out my program!

DISCLAIMER: I am not an educator by any means, nor am I a programmer. I started learning to code about a month and a half ago, as of July 7th, 2024.
I wanted to make this quiz program as a way to help myself learn.

The goal of this project is to get some practice with naming functions, using git often, leaving clear commit messages, adding 
useful notes in my code (still working on that one especially), and having a nice little refesher quiz game when I want to brush up on the syntax.

Things I want to add in the future:

    -Different game modes i.e. 'Fill in the Blanks', 'Hard Mode', etc.

    -a UI using Flask, HTML, and CSS

    -Maybe some sort of scoreboard if the future game modes call for it

I will continue to add more questions and cover as many functions as I can. Please feel free to give me as many constructive criticisms as you want,
I want to learn as much as I can. 

Excuse the odd typo here and there, but feel free to let me know if you catch any.

Shout out to flexiple.com, their rundown of Python commands has been very helpful.
